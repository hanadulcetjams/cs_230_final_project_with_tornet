# CS 230 Final Project: Working with TorNet data
### Handong Park
### hdparkhd@stanford.edu

This repository was created by forking from the MIT TorNet paper - and is primarily here for the purpose of developing improvements to the baseline CNN model used in the TorNet paper.
To do so, I'll be working to first work with the data (learn how to pull it, load it, preprocess it, etc.), then replicate the results of the paper by retraining the CNN architecture that was used in the paper.

From there, I'll be working to both try to use YOLO and transfer learning to see if I can improve model performance with that, and also investigate whether data augmentation can help solve the class imbalance problem.

For reference, the folders labeled `cs_230_` are those that I've created and where my work is taking place, whereas the other folders are originally from TorNet.
Note that I have not uploaded the data here (instead, I've opted to just show the process of how it was downloaded using `zenodo_get`).
